With an area of 2,250 square kilometers Lake Tai in eastern China is the third largest freshwater lake after Poyang Lake and Dongting Lake. The lake houses about 90 islands, ranging in size from a few square meters to several square kilometers. The lake is also known for its productive fishing industry. Since the late 1970s, harvesting fish and crabs has been invaluable to people living along the lake and has contributed significantly to the economy of the surrounding area. The lake area is home to an extensive ceramics industry, including the Yixing pottery factory, which produces the world-renowned Yixing clay teapots.
